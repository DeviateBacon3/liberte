The OTFE volume resize process should be safe.
In case anything fails (e.g., insufficient disk space, or busy device
during unmount), just fix the problem and retry. No single step depends
on subsequent steps to succeed.

The OTFE header is unaffected by the resize, so any existing header
backup is still valid.
